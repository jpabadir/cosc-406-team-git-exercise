# cosc-406-team-git-exercise

The aim of this git exercise is to create a multi-purpose program, which will be able to do the following: 

1) Ask the user which of the below three actions (s)he wants to perfom
2) Execute the right action depending on the user's response. 

Possible actions: 

A) Convert a given sum in USDs to CAD (at a pre-programmed rate); </br>
B) Computes the double of the number entered by user; </br>
C) Take a string from the user, and return the same string with all uppercase letters as lowercase, and vice-versa </br>

In all cases, we will deal with bad input from the user by using an if condition to check for such input, print an error message, and then interrupt the program. 

Each member of the team will implement one of the features A, B or C, and the fourth member will take care of the general driver, which is reponsible for asking the user what feature they want, and then executing the right piece of code.
